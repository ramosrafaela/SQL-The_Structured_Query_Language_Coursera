# **The Structured Query Language (SQL) - Cousera**

In this course, I learned about the Structured Query Language ("SQL".)   There was a review of the origins of the language and its conceptual foundations.  Focusing on learning all the standard SQL commands, their syntax, and how to use these commands to conduct analysis of the data within a relational database.  The scope includes not only the SELECT statement for retrieving data and creating analytical reports, but also includes the DDL ("Data Definition Language") and DML ("Data Manipulation Language") commands necessary to create and maintain database objects.

The files present in this repository refer to the exercises in each lab and the final test with more advanced questions. 

The course taked 28 hours and I got approved. The certification can be visualized below:
